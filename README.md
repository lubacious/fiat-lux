better than hello world, I guess

But for real, this is a great piece of evidence that I should be hired.

I mean this is really good stuff - a website (made from a fucking template dude!,)
a github repository (I marginally modified the recipe for Hello, World!,)
a bunch of photos I took to show artsy fartsy aesthetic vision.
